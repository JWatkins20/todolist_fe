## Todolist Frontend
The purpose of this site was to make a tool for me to use in order to better organize my todo's. Right now the site looks rudimentary, but I plan on trying to make it look more professional and also add more than just one list(like one for weekly goals and monthly goals, etc.) 

I also want to set up an SMTP server so I can email user reminders. Stay tuned!
